Short Introduction of Barracuda Central

http://www.barracudacentral.org/

Barracuda Central maintains an Barracuda Reputation Block List (BRBL)

Starting in September 2008, Barracuda Networks introduced the Barracuda Reputation Block List (BRBL â€“ pronounced "bahr-bel") as a free DNSBL of IP addresses known to send spam. Barracuda Networks fights spam and created the BRBL to help stop the spread of spam.

Registration is simple and immediate. Please note that this service is provided free of charge, therefore Barracuda Networks reserves the right to refuse service to spammers, competitors and other parties at the company's discretion. This service is provided as is with no warranty of any kind.

Just register for free at http://www.barracudacentral.org/account/register

Your account will get activated within 10 minutes, specify the IP address from where you are going to request the checking process so that you won't get banned or rate limited. For time being the provided script will work as it also accepts limited number of requests from localhost i.e 1270.0.1.

*I again repeat that if you provide your IP address in your account from which you are going to send the IP validation requests you won't get rate limited and there aren't any capping on any number of requests, but still i assume you shouldn't bombard with requests at once, you need to manage your request cycle efficently.
